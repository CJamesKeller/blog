    <p>
      Going to start writing a blog, and slowly adding onto the method I'm using.
      We'll see how it goes, I know I've said I would do this in the past and just haven't.
      For now, it's gonna be very basic, and that's good.
      A little copy-paste from a template, write the text content, run deploy, that's it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's just so odd to be preparing to have a baby, during a pandemic,
      after having to switch jobs unexpectedly, with protests and riots,
      in our still-new-to-us house, and there's the election coming up,
      plus all the changes that have happened in our family otherwise...
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose life exists in the motion between what changes and what stays the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, we'll see how this goes. Hopefully this is set up to be easy enough
      that I will keep it up once the baby arrives.
